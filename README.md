### I built this by cloning the [Bootstrap 4](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/) template made by [Blackrock Digital](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-clean-blog), however, I made some changes.

### In `gulpfile.js` I added two lines to the `browserSync` function:

```
function browserSync(done) {
  browsersync.init({
    server: {
      baseDir: './',
    },
    port: 3000,
->  notify: false,
->  browser: ['chrome', 'iexplore'],
  })
  done()
}
```

### In order to suppress the (imo) annoying browser-sync notification that pops up every single time, the `notify: false` flag was added, and to visually verify style changes wouldn't break Internet Explorer, I added it to the browser list.

### I changed the source directory in the `modules` function from bootstrap's /css to /scss, so I could grab styles from the /vendor directory more easily and make any changes I want.

### I changed the source directory in the `js` function to include all the javascript, because, why not???

### I noticed that for some reason, maybe there was a conflict with some settings in my IDE, I was not seeing immediate browser refresh after changes, so I had to change the third line of the `watchFiles` function from 
```
gulp.watch("./**/*.html", browserSyncReload)
```
###to 
```
gulp.watch("./*.html").on('change', browserSyncReload)
```
### THEN, I was not happy with just instantly seeing my style changes. I wanted instant git commit, push, and Netlify publish also, and it was easier than I thought it would be! I added `deploy.js`, and added a deploy script to `package.json`, and ta-da! üòÅ
